### Welcome!

I am a postdoctoral researcher (Adiunkt) in the <a href="http://www.qmbt.if.uj.edu.pl/">Quantum Many-Body Theory Group</a>  of the <a href="https://ift.uj.edu.pl/">Institute of Theoretical Physics</a>, <a href="https://www.uj.edu.pl/">Jagiellonian University</a>, where I study the nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems, in particular one-dimensional quasicondensates.

I received my PhD in Physics from the University of Queensland in 2021 under the supervision of <a href="https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/KarenKheruntsyan/">Prof. Kar&#233;n V. Kheruntsyan</a>. Before coming to Australia for my PhD, I was a faculty member in the <a href="https://imsp.cas.uplb.edu.ph/">Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Physics</a> of the <a href="https://uplb.edu.ph/main/">University of the Philippines, Los Ba&ntilde;os</a> from 2015 to 2017. Previously, I received my MSc in Physics from the <a href="https://upd.edu.ph/">University of the Philippines, Diliman</a> in 2015, and a BSc in Physics from the <a href="https://www.ateneo.edu/">Ateneo de Manila University</a> in 2013.

### About me

I am a physicist working in the field of quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics.
I received my undergraduate degree in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1939 and went on to earn my PhD from Princeton University in 1942.
After completing my doctoral studies, I worked on the Manhattan Project, where I helped develop the first atomic bombs.
After the war, I returned to academia, holding teaching and research positions at Cornell and now at the California Institute of Technology.
