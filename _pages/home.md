### Welcome!

#### Pax et bonum!

I am a postdoctoral researcher (Adiunkt) in the <a href="http://www.qmbt.if.uj.edu.pl/">Quantum Many-Body Theory Group</a> at the <a href="https://ift.uj.edu.pl/">Institute of Theoretical Physics</a>, <a href="https://www.uj.edu.pl/">Jagiellonian University</a>. My research focuses on the nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems, in particular quantum gases and spin systems.

I earned my PhD in Physics from <a href="https://smp.uq.edu.au/">The University of Queensland</a> in 2021, under the supervision of <a href="https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/KarenKheruntsyan/">Prof. Kar&#233;n V. Kheruntsyan</a>. Prior to my PhD, I was a faculty member at the <a href="https://imsp.cas.uplb.edu.ph/">Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Physics</a>, <a href="https://uplb.edu.ph/main/">University of the Philippines, Los Ba&ntilde;os</a> from 2015 to 2017. I hold an MSc in Physics from the <a href="https://nip.upd.edu.ph/">University of the Philippines, Diliman</a> (2015), and a BSc in Physics from the <a href="https://www.ateneo.edu/">Ateneo de Manila University</a> (2013).

Outside of physics, I enjoy running, hiking, watching football (#COYG!), and watching some animes and kdramas.
