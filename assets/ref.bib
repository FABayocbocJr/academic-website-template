    abstract = {We study the dynamics of the electron current in nanodevices where there are time-varying components and interactions. These devices are a nanojunction attached to heat baths and with dynamical electron-phonon interactions, and a nanojunction with photon beams incident and reflected at the channel. We use the two-time nonequilibrium Greenâ€™s functions technique to calculate the time-dependent electron current flowing across the devices. We find that whenever a sudden change occurs in the device, the current takes time to react to the abrupt change, overshoots, oscillates, and eventually settles down to a steady value. With dynamical electron-phonon interactions, the interaction gives rise to a net resistance that reduces the flow of current across the device when a source-drain bias potential is attached. In the presence of dynamical electron-photon interactions, the photons drive the electrons to flow. The direction of flow, however, depends on the frequencies of the incident photons. Furthermore, the direction of electron flow in one lead is exactly opposite to the direction of flow in the other lead thereby resulting in no net change in current flowing across the device.},

  abstract={Ultracold atom experiments are a great experimental platform for studying many-body physics due to their isolation and high tunability. In particular, they are excellent candidates for studying many paradigmatic models of quantum many-body physics with a high degree of accuracy. Advances in ultracold atom experiments have enabled the realisation of lower-dimensional systems that have been of theoretical interest historically. Low dimensional systems have several striking differences from their three-dimensional counterparts; most notable is the absence of Bose-Einstein condensation in the thermodynamic limit. In this thesis, we study the nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body interacting ultracold Bose gases. We are particularly interested in quenches of Bose gases in one spatial dimension and their subsequent time-evolution and relaxation dynamics. We present numerical simulations of one-dimensional Bose gases where we incorporate thermal and quantum fluctuations and investigate their effects on the post-quench dynamics of the system.

First, we consider a system of two tunnel-coupled, one-dimensional quasicondensates following a quench of the coupling strength from zero to a fixed finite value. More specifically, starting from two independent quasicondensates in equilibrium, with an initial temperature and chemical potential imbalance, we suddenly switch on the tunnel-coupling and analyse the post-quench equilibration dynamics. We find that after coupling the quasicondensates, the low-energy particles flow predominantly from the colder quasicondensate to the hotter one, whereas the reverse is true for the higher-energy particles. The net energy flow is governed by the surplus (or otherwise) of the overall number of lower energy particles flowing from the initially colder quasicondensate to the initially hotter quasicondensate, compared to the overall number of higher-energy particles flowing in the opposite direction. We also find that the coupled quasicondensates can evolve to a relaxed state with a higher equilibrium temperature than their initial temperature. Surprisingly, we find that, though the final equilibrium temperature is higher, the system can have a higher phase coherence within each quasicondensate.

We also consider the case where the two quasicondensates in the system above contain an equal number of particles with an initial phase difference. The two quasicondensates are obtained from the coherent splitting of a single quasicondensate. After imprinting an initial phase difference, we abruptly turn on the coupling strength between the two and characterise the post-quench dynamics. This is motivated by a recent experiment of Pigneur et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 173601 (2018), where the fast relaxation of the system to a phase-locked state cannot be described by the quantum sine-Gordon model that has described their experimental results well in the past. We find that our 1D simulations of the experiment can reproduce the phase-locked steady state but not the fast decay observed in the experiment.

We then investigate the breathing mode oscillations of a one-dimensional Bose gas after a quench of the longitudinal harmonic trap frequency. In particular, after preparing a Bose gas at a chemical potential and temperature, we suddenly change the longitudinal trapping frequency to a lower value and observe the dynamics of the gas. We find that two breathing modes corresponding to two components of the system exist: low-energy particles occupying the bulk and high-energy particles in the tails of the Bose gas. Each component has its own distinct breathing frequency and damping rate. We find that the low-energy particles in the bulk have dynamical behaviour closer to that of a zero temperature quasicondensate, whereas highly energetic particles in the tails have dynamical behaviour closer to that of an ideal Bose gas. We also find that the damping rate of the quasicondensate is much lower than the rate predicted from one-dimensional Landau damping.

Lastly, we consider the effects of thermal and quantum fluctuations on the dynamics of dispersive quantum shock waves in a one-dimensional Bose gas. Starting with a local density bump on top of a uniform background density, we let the former expand into the latter and observe the formation and dynamics of dispersive shock waves. Here, the oscillatory train that forms after releasing the local density bump results from quantum mechanical self-interference. We find that the amplitude of oscillation decreases with the increase of temperature due to the reduced phase coherence within the Bose gas. Furthermore, we find that vacuum and thermal fluctuations can significantly wash out the amplitude of oscillations due to shot-to-shot fluctuations in the position of interference fringes around the mean.},
